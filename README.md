# SideCar

SideCar is a lightweight, extensible engine for rendering content on auxiliary displays, such as the secondary screen found on devices like the Positivo Vision R15 M.

It is not a fixed-purpose application or a static viewer. SideCar acts as a **rendering runtime**, where content, layout, and style are defined through configuration files or scripts.

## Purpose

SideCar is built around a clear separation of concerns:

- A **core engine** responsible for display communication and rendering
- **Content definitions** provided via configuration or scripts
- **Layout and styling** fully controlled by the user or the community

This design allows new panels, widgets, and visual styles to be added without modifying the core.

## Features

- Lightweight and minimal core
- Extensible architecture
- Scriptable or configuration-driven content
- Renderer decoupled from data sources
- Designed for customization and community contributions

## Philosophy

SideCar does not decide what should be displayed.  
It only provides the tools to display it.

An auxiliary screen is not a decorative element; it is an information surface.  
SideCar exists to unlock its potential without enforcing a single use case.

## Project Status

🚧 Work in progress.  
APIs and configuration formats are subject to change.

## Name

The name *SideCar* reflects the idea of something that accompanies the main system:  
it does not replace it, compete with it, or take control — it simply extends it.

More documentation will be added as the project evolves.
